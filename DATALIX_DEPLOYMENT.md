## üß™ **POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING**

### **Test Enhanced Scoring:**
1. Visit your AdCopySurge app
2. Analyze a generic ad like: "Best solution ever! Click here to learn more!"
3. **Expected Result**: Score should be 40-50% (not 86%!)

### **Test Improve Ad Feature:**
1. After analyzing an ad, look for "üöÄ Improve This Ad" button
2. Click it and wait for loading
3. **Expected Result**: 3 accordion sections with strategic variants
4. Test copy-to-clipboard functionality

### **Test Enhanced Feedback:**
1. Check analysis feedback section
2. **Expected Result**: Specific suggestions like "Add emotional trigger words" instead of generic "Good ad copy"

## ‚öôÔ∏è **OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS**

### **Add OpenAI API Key** (for AI-powered improvements)
```bash
# Add to your environment variables
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" >> .env

# Restart backend services
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
```

### **Monitor Logs**
```bash
# Check for any errors
journalctl -u gunicorn -f
journalctl -u celery -f

# Or check application logs
tail -f /path/to/logs/application.log
```

---

## üêõ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Backend Fails to Start:**
```bash
# Check if new dependencies are installed
pip list | grep -E "(openai|transformers|numpy)"

# Test import manually
python -c "from app.utils.scoring_calibration import BaselineScoreCalibrator; print('‚úÖ Scoring system working')"
```

### **If Frontend Build Fails:**
```bash
# Clear node modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### **If "Improve Ad" Button Doesn't Work:**
- Check network tab in browser for API errors
- Verify `/api/ads/improve` endpoint is accessible
- Check backend logs for ImportError messages

### **If Scoring Still Shows 86%:**
- Verify enhanced scoring is integrated in `main_launch_ready.py`
- Check that `calculate_overall_score` function is updated
- Restart backend services completely
