# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Your React/Supabase application was experiencing "No API key found in request" errors (401 Unauthorized) despite having valid authentication sessions. The user appeared authenticated locally but API requests were failing.

## Root Cause
The custom `fetch` implementation in `supabaseClient.js` was potentially overriding critical authentication headers that Supabase needs to authenticate requests.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Custom Fetch Implementation
**File:** `src/lib/supabaseClient.js`

**Problem:** The custom fetch wrapper was adding headers without preserving existing ones properly.

**Solution:** Modified the header merging logic to preserve all original headers (including `apikey` and `Authorization`) while only conditionally adding custom headers.

```javascript
// OLD (problematic)
headers: {
  ...options.headers,
  'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
  'Connection': 'keep-alive'
}

// NEW (fixed)
headers: {
  // Preserve all original headers (including apikey and Authorization)
  ...options.headers,
  // Only add these if they don't already exist
  ...(options.headers && !options.headers['Cache-Control'] && { 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache' }),
  ...(options.headers && !options.headers['Connection'] && { 'Connection': 'keep-alive' })
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Debug Logging
Added debug logging to track authentication headers in development:

```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && url.includes('supabase.co')) {
  console.log('üîç Supabase Request:', {
    url: url.replace(/https:\/\/[^.]+\.supabase\.co/, '[SUPABASE_URL]'),
    hasApiKey: !!(options.headers?.apikey || options.headers?.['apikey']),
    hasAuth: !!(options.headers?.authorization || options.headers?.['Authorization']),
    method: options.method || 'GET'
  });
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Authentication Diagnostics
**File:** `src/utils/authDebug.js`

Added comprehensive testing for the specific tables that were failing:
- `user_profiles` table queries
- `ad_copy_projects` table queries
- Detailed error reporting with codes and hints
- Specific guidance for "No API key found" errors

## Verification Steps

### 1. Environment Configuration ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `.env` file has correct `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`
- ‚úÖ `.env` file has correct `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`  
- ‚úÖ `.env.production` file has matching configuration
- ‚úÖ All environment variables use correct `REACT_APP_` prefix

### 2. Code Changes Applied ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Fixed custom fetch implementation in `supabaseClient.js`
- ‚úÖ Added debug logging for authentication issues
- ‚úÖ Enhanced authentication diagnostics utility

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Restart Development Server**
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test the Fix in Browser**
   - Open your app in browser
   - Login with your test account (malabu@yahoo.com)
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab
   - Run: `window.runAuthDiagnostics()`
   - Check if API requests now succeed

3. **Monitor Network Requests**
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab
   - Clear network log
   - Perform actions that previously failed
   - Look for Supabase API requests
   - Verify they have either:
     - `apikey` header with your anon key, OR
     - `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` header

### If Issues Persist:

1. **Clear Browser Data**
   ```javascript
   // Run in browser console
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   // Then refresh page
   ```

2. **Check Network Tab**
   - Look for failing requests to `*.supabase.co`
   - Check request headers
   - Screenshot any 401 errors for further debugging

3. **Run Enhanced Diagnostics**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   window.runAuthDiagnostics()
   ```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No more "No API key found in request" errors
- ‚úÖ Successful loading of dashboard analytics
- ‚úÖ Successful loading of user profiles
- ‚úÖ Successful loading of project data
- ‚úÖ Debug logs showing proper authentication headers

## Additional Monitoring

The remaining todo items for comprehensive monitoring:

### Row-Level Security Audit (Optional)
If issues persist after the fix, check your Supabase database policies:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('user_profiles', 'ad_copy_projects');
```

Ensure policies allow `auth.role() = 'authenticated'` users to access their own data.

## Test Script

A test script has been created: `test-auth-fix.js`

Run with: `node test-auth-fix.js`

This verifies the header preservation logic is working correctly.

## Contact for Support

If you continue to experience authentication issues after following these steps:

1. Run `window.runAuthDiagnostics()` in browser console
2. Take screenshots of:
   - Console errors
   - Network tab showing failed requests
   - Headers of failing requests
3. Check Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Logs for server-side error details

The fix addresses the most common cause of this issue - improper header handling in custom fetch implementations.
